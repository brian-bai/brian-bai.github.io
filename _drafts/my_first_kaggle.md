categories:  DataScience

I have enjoyed the kaggle for a while. I learned alot from the experience with Kaggle. 

## Why Kaggle
As a professional SAS programmer, my job is more about finish the job on schedule with acceptable delivery.
After immersed in the stuff for a while, I can finish the tasks quickly. The daily routine is important for the client and I do it cause it's my job.
Things became not attractive anymore after years of working for one project.

When I attended online data science course, I heard alot about Kaggle and went to check what it is.
It is the most fun part during the learning and practice process.

On Kaggle, there're more than enough competitions with all kinds of problems that can be solved or understand well by data science.
I can select the interesting competition to practice my skills and learn from others.

## My first Kaggle
The first competition I attended is:
